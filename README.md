# Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook Premix

This repository contains the "premix" configs for the geeky self-hosted recipies found at https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/

## Introduction

These are my (David's) personal configs, often more up-to-date than what's published in the cookbook. However, since they're mine, you'll need to edit the .ymls and change "funkypenguin.co.nz" to whatever _your_ domain is :)

## How to use ?

1. At a high level, ```git pull git@gitlab.com:funkypenguin/geek-cookbook-premix.git /var/data/config```.
2. For each recipe, edit the .yml and replace my config (data paths, funkypenguin.co.nz domain name, etc) with yours
3. Where a ```<recipie name>.env-sample``` exists, rename this to ```<recipe-name>.env```, and customize
